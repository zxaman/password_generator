# Secure Password Generator

This Python script generates strong, random passwords that meet complexity requirements. It allows you to customize the password length and include different character types for increased security.

## Explanation of Terms

**Password Strength:** A measure of how difficult it is to guess or crack a password. Strong passwords are typically longer and contain a variety of character types.

**Complexity Requirements:** Guidelines or rules that define what makes a password strong. These often include minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

**Randomization:** The process of selecting characters for the password in an unpredictable way. This makes it harder for attackers to guess the password.

**Character Types:** The different kinds of characters that can be used in a password. Common types include:
- **Uppercase Letters (A-Z):** Characters from the capital alphabet.
- **Lowercase Letters (a-z):** Characters from the lowercase alphabet.
- **Digits (0-9):** Numbers.
- **Symbols (!@#$%^&*):** Special characters that are not letters or numbers.

## How to Use This Script

1. **Save the code:** Paste the provided Python code into a file named `password_generator.py`.

2. **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:

    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts:** The script will ask you for the desired password length and whether you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

4. **Secure your password:** The script will generate a strong password based on your selections and display it on the console. Write down the password securely and avoid storing it electronically in plain text.

**Note:** It's important to never share your generated password with anyone.

## Additional Notes

- This script uses the `random` module in Python to generate random characters for the password.
- The script ensures that at least one character type is selected to avoid generating empty passwords.
- You can modify the script to customize it further, such as specifying a minimum complexity requirement.
